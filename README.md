# Neural Style Transfer

This repository contains a script that allows one to combine the style of one image to a base image.

# Model

Check out Context.txt

## Example

Base Image:
![Cat](https://github.com/JinLi711/Neural-Style-Transfer/blob/master/images/target/cat.jpg | width=48)

<img src="https://github.com/JinLi711/Neural-Style-Transfer/blob/master/images/target/cat.jpg" alt="Cat" width="200" height="200">

Style: 
![Trippy](https://github.com/JinLi711/Neural-Style-Transfer/blob/master/images/style/trippy.jpg)

## Things To Work On

I could train the VGG model to incorporate a style, so every time I want to incorporate a certain style, I would only have to run the image through once and the results would be instant.

## Acknowledgements

The code in the repository is based off of the neural style transfer from Keras.
