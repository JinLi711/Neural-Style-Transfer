# Neural Style Transfer

This repository contains a script that allows one to combine the style of one image to a base image.

## Things To Work On

I could train the VGG model to incorporate a style, so every time I want to incorporate a certain style, I would only have to run the image through once and the results would be instant.

## Acknowledgements

The code in the repository is based off of the neural style transfer from Keras.
